# Data Science in Malicious Files Search: Project Overview
### Created a tool that predicts whether a file is malicious based on a list of statically imported .exe file libraries
* Preprocessed data for analysis
* Conducted a comparative analysis of different classifiers: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, K-Neighbors Classifier, SGD Classifier
* Illustrated quality of classifiers by PR and ROC curves
* Compiled a report on the quality of classifiers based on validation data (validation.txt)
* Created a forecast of the file's malignancy based on the imported libraries (1 â€” if the file is malicious, 0 - otherwise) (prediction.txt)
* Created an explanation file, where for each line of the test sample file contains the reason why the model considered this file malicious (the lines for non-malicious files remain empty) (explain.txt)
